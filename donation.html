<p><font color=white>Malaysia is a country known for its strong sense of community and compassion. This is reflected in the generous spirit of its people, who are always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. Charity and donation are deeply ingrained in Malaysian culture, and there are many different ways that people give back to their communities. One of the most popular ways to donate in Malaysia is through zakat, an Islamic religious obligation that requires Muslims to donate a portion of their wealth to the poor and needy. Zakat is typically paid during the month of Ramadan, but it can also be given throughout the year. Many mosques and zakat collection centers make it easy for people to fulfill their zakat obligations. In addition to zakat, there are many other charitable organizations in Malaysia that rely on donations to support their work. These organizations provide a variety of services, such as food and shelter for the homeless, medical care for the sick, and education for the underprivileged. Malaysians are very supportive of these organizations, and they donate generously both time and money.</font></p>
