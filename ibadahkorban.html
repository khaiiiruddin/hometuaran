<p><font color=white>The annual ibadah korban, or Hari Raya Haji, is a joyous and solemn occasion in Malaysia. It is a time for Muslims to commemorate the Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God. In Malaysia, the ibadah korban is celebrated on the 10th day of Zulhijjah, the month of the Hajj pilgrimage. On the morning of Eid al-Adha, Muslims gather at mosques or open-air prayer grounds to perform the Eid prayers. After the prayers, they proceed to slaughter their sacrificial animals, which are usually sheep, goats, or cows. The meat is then divided into three parts: one-third for the immediate family, one-third for relatives and friends, and one-third for the poor and needy.The ibadah korban is a reminder of the importance of sacrifice and obedience to God. It is also a time for Muslims to come together and celebrate their faith. The streets of Malaysia are filled with the sights and sounds of the celebrations, as families and friends gather to enjoy a meal of traditional Eid dishes.

The ibadah korban is a deeply meaningful tradition for Malaysian Muslims. It is a time to reflect on their faith and to give thanks for God's blessings. It is also a time to reach out to those in need and to share their blessings with others.</font></p>
